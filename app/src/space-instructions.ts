/**
 * Per-space standing orders for an LLM working inside a space.
 *
 * A space's voice is stable and belongs with the space: one wants German,
 * another English; one a dry technical register, another narrative. Repeating
 * that in every session is the friction this removes. It deliberately does not
 * live in a global CLAUDE.md — the constraint only matters while an agent is
 * inside a KB25 space, and loading every space's rules into unrelated sessions
 * is the pollution to avoid.
 *
 * The text lives at `kb/<space>/_instructions.md`. The `_` prefix means
 * `Content.walk` skips it (the same rule that hides `_assets/`), so it never
 * appears in the sidebar, `kb_search`, the note sweep, or `resources/list`. But
 * `Content.resolve` does *not* apply that rule, so `<space>/_instructions`
 * resolves like any other slug — which is why the existing editor, diff viewer
 * and per-space auto-commit all work on it untouched.
 *
 * Both surfaces share this module: `mcp.ts` delivers the text to the model and
 * enforces the read-before-write token; `server.ts` scaffolds and edits it. It
 * is its own module rather than living in `mcp.ts` because `mcp.ts` builds an
 * `McpServer` at import time and so can never be imported by the web server.

 * - **Freshness, for free.** The text is an input, so editing the file changes
 *   every valid token. An outstanding token stops verifying the moment a person
 *   saves a change, forcing a re-read. Injection alone cannot promise that.
